\chapter{From a small startup to a global enterprise}
\label{cha:intro}
\section{What to expect from Capitalism X (CapX)}
Nike\\

Did you ever test out your economic skills and entrepreneurial spirit? Did you ever wish to take action and do things your way? Did you ever think that with the steering wheel in your hand, you'd give a company a whole new direction and possibility to rise? 

CapitalismX now gives you the possibility to become CEO! This business simulation game, which is equally fun and educative, gives you the chance to prove your successful way of managing a company through decades. You are going to start with a small IT company and, with your sophisticated input, you can build up an enterprise.

The goal of this interactive business simulation game is simple: Maximize your company's profit! As a CEO you will have to take care of multiple issues, that occur in daily business, such as defining your product portfolio, controlling your financial status, managing employees and so on. However, also unforeseen events might occur suddenly! In these cases, you can prove your decision-making abilities and save your company out of delicate situations. 

Sth like: you can expect a game, which shows you the economical and xxxx processes and activities, that define the daily work in a start up until it becomes a big company. Of course, all processes and activities are displayed in a simplified manner to reduce complexity. However, you will still get a rough overview xxxxx.

\emph{Very Important:} Besides being a game-play handbook, this document also addresses the game mechanisms working in the background
 
\section{Player's role}
Maike\\
You will take on the role of CEO for either a start-up or a midsize company which is about to fail. During your career, you will encounter several obstacles and lead the business. So, you will slip into various roles, such as head of human resources, production or logistics, in order to take the necessary measures to run a successful business. Daily tasks include hiring, firing, motivating and training employees, innovating and manufacturing products, deciding on the product portfolio, dealing with government issues and taking financial figures into account. In summary, you will decide on all the features provided in this game. Your decisions are then integrated into finance, human resources, procurement, production, warehousing, logistics and marketing and will finally affect the performance of your company.

\section{Setting \& Story}
\label{SettingStory}
Livja and Philipp\\

\begin{figure} [!htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics [width=\textwidth] {images/startingScreen.png}
    \caption{Start a Game in CapitalismX}
    \label{fig:startingScreen}
\end{figure}

As displayed in figure \ref{fig:startingScreen} You have the possibility to start a new game or load an existing game and start right away where to took off earlier (requires sign-in). When starting a new game, you have to create an account first, so that you can stop the game and continue later on. For registration you will need a valid email address and your name. After successful registration, you can select a nickname (hei√üt das heute noch so???) and a company name. 

It is recommended to have a look at the tutorial provided after the registration process if you have not played CapitalismX before. Also, it might be very helpful to read this game manual before, as it gives you a couple of hints about how to handle some situations. The tutorial is a short Video, that gives you an overview about the different buildings and dashbaords in the game. Also, it provides you with step-by-step instructions how to perform the most important activities.

\section{Interface \& Features}

\subsection{Controls}  
The main screen after starting a new game or loading a game in CapitalismX is an interactive map of all functional and non-functional buildings, such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the CapitalismX headquarters, where your finance department, your HR department and your marketing department are located. 
    \item the bank, where you can request a loan.
    \item the harbor, where you can procure the components you need in order to manufacture your products.
    \item the employee market, where you can hire your employees.
    \item the production facilities, where you can manufacture your products.
    \item anything else?
\end{itemize}

You can adapt settings or get an overview about the department specific performance by either clicking on the functional buildings or using the navigation bar at the top of the screen. The departments in the navigation bar are finance, HR, production and marketing and include links to all other functionalities in the game. 
\begin{figure} [!htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics [width=\textwidth]{images/navigationBar.png}
    \caption{Navigation Bar}
    \label{fig:navigationBar}
\end{figure} The detailed actions and settings are described in later chapters, but in the following you get an overview about the different actions that you can do by using the navigation bar.

In the HR view, you can adapt all settings regarding human resources and employees, such as hiring and firing employees. Also you get insights about the employee satisfaction and other key figures. For more information about the HR view, please go to chapter \ref{HR_manual}.
The finance view, provides you with an overview about the financial situation of the company, by giving you dashboard consisting of different performance indicators, such as cashflow and net worth of company. Also, you might take action on financial topics, such as loaning money from the bank. You can find details in chapter \ref{finance_manual}.
Next, you can procure, produce and sell goods and equipment in the production view. For more insights on procurement, production and selling, please take a look at chapter \ref{production_manual}. 
Last but not least, you can visit the marketing area, where you can start marketing campaigns, start market research activities or commission consulting companies. You can find more information in chapter \ref{marketing_manual}.

Throughout the game time passes starting from 1990 on. You can revisit this time at the top right corner of the screen and can be seen in picture \ref{fig:time}.
\begin{figure} [!htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{images/time.png}
    \caption{Time in CapitalismX}
    \label{fig:time}
\end{figure}
Next to the time box, there is a little "pause" sign, where you can pause the time in case you want to adapt some settings and do not want the time to elapse before you finished your adaptations.

Apart from that, at the bottom of the screen you can find a newsticker-banner, that gives you decent hints about possible settings to adapt. [EXAMPLE???]%maybe Daniel you have an example?

In CaptialismX some unexpected incidents may happen to your company or to the environment, for example it could happen that an earthquake destroys part of your production facility or that a sudden hacker attack is going to steal sensitive data from you. In these cases, urgent intervention from you is needed! Therefore, a pop-up window will open, where you have instant decisions to be taken and actions to start. It is absolutely not recommended to ignore such pop-up windows, because omitted action is highly probable to cause your company huge damage.

\subsection{Choose the portfolio}
Nike - Description of products 

You as the CEO decide which products you want to offer. In CapitalismX, there are two different types of products. Those two different groups are first manufactured goods, and second, retail products that are simply bought as a whole and resold under the company brand.

To start with the retail products, consisting of two different sub-groups of products: the mass storage devices and the movie playback devices. As the products evolve over the time frame of the game, the scope of the single product group also changes. Mass storage devices will evolve, given a decent investment to innovate, from CD over DVD to BlueRay, from small SD cards to SD cards with very large memory, and from USB Sticks with small memory and in simple versions to evolved versions with large memory. [FURTHER DESCRIPTION OF PRODUCTS NEEDED?!] Movie playback devices may evolve from simple video recorders for recording tapes to DVD and BlueRay player, that even can become smart. 

The larger part of the product portfolio is displayed by the manufactured goods. To produce those, the player has to slip into the role of a strategic head of manufacturing and has to take care about the education and satisfaction of employees in order to provide a high manufacturing and therefore also high product quality; about the procurement of components and warehousing of products; and so on.
The manufactured goods are divided into four product sub-groups, which are notebooks, phones, gameboys, and televisions. 

Contrary to retail products, the manufactured products consist of single components, that the player needs to procure in the procurement view. Also, the player needs engineers in order to aggregate the components to products. As described in section [CHAPTER REFERENCE]], the education and skills of the engineers influence the quality of the product. Other than that, the product quality is also determined on the component's actuality. Another difference to the retail products is, that the manufactured product's evolution is depicted by different levels, meaning that a notebook always stays a notebook, but it surely evolves to a higher performing version. To put it into a nutshell, the player has to continuously innovate and invest in new components, skilled engineers, and procurement of components in order to achieve the best competitive products. 

Apart from that, the player has the possibility to produce more than one product from a product sub-group, which offers various strategic advantages. For example, it is possible to produce two different phones at the same time, to test out different features and product strategies in the market. Phone A could be a very basic, simple phone, suitable for basic tasks like phone calls, messages, emails, surfing in the web. Obviously, Phone A would have a rather cheap price, but also the components do not need to be the latest state of the art tech. Phone B on the other side, could be a very advanced hence expensive phone, including a high resolution camera, high-speed internet connectivity and a fast CPU.

\section{Challenges \& Opportunities}
Planning plays an essential part in business, but not everything can be foreseen. Companies and their executives must deal with uncertainty. Let's imagine that you just packed your bags for holiday and it gets lost at the airport. Did you consider this scenario before it happened? Running a business is similar: You can cover many scenarios and possibilities, but not everything. Therefore the game includes challenges and opportunities. Some of them are the result of bad management, some are rewarding. Some are influenced by your actions as a player, others come around occasionally.\\
Their effects become visible via various indicators, like financial figures, warehouse or customer satisfaction. An immediate response is necessary to minimize negative consequences. Or to grab the chance when it is offered.

\section{External events}
This section deals with the influence of events that happen during the course of the game. Companies have to deal with influencing factors which are neither planned nor foreseeable\cite{Campbell}. This section refers to 'external' events as they are out of the players explicit and obvious control. Actions taken may still have an influence on an event's probability to happen, but this is invisible for the player. From a location point of view events can take place inside the company, for example strikes, or outside like rising taxes. Punishment for mistakes is common, but the player may also be rewarded when outstanding performance is present. There are 18 distinct events divided into 5 categories and acting as counterparts to the game features:
\begin{itemize}
\item Production, Company and Market
\item Money and Tax
\item Employees
\item Natural Disasters
\item Government and Politics
\end{itemize}

Events are mostly cross-functional. This means that the trigger of an event belongs to one simulation in the game while the result affects another simulation. The parameters which effect an event are named 'Influencing factors'. Each event is assigned a property of the following 4 characteristics:

\begin{itemize}
\item Random or Conditional: Random events have a probability which is not changed throughout the game. Conditional events have some preconditions that must be met to get the probability activated.
\item Rising probability or certain occurrence: Probabilities may rise exponentially or linear when an influencing indicator gets worse. Alternatively the occurrence is certain if a specific threshold is hit.
\item Starting or final thresholds applicable: To get a probability higher than 0, some threshold value of an influencing factor must be met. A threshold is not mandatory and by nature, not applicable to random events.
\item Impact on a game mechanic: Only notification events do not impact a variable in one of the game simulations.An event normally impacts a game mechanic when triggered.
\end{itemize}

The decision which event should get which characteristic was based on multiple aspects. In general, a business simulation intends to reflect the real-world which is also applicable for one-time events. Their nature and likeliness to happen are to be transferred to the game environment. But there are aspects which are contradictory to this intend. Empirical evidence for the probability of events might be rare or the probability is so low that they would happen almost never throughout the game. Events having such an impact that they lead to a Game-Over must not happen in an early state and frustrate the player. In the end gaming should be fun too, not only replaying the real-world. Reflecting the latter is also limited as a simulation can never cover every 'live' aspect. As a result of these considerations, a probability can distort from its real-world example. If suitable, an event can even have a complete random occurrence providing a more challenging game experience to the player. This is the case for 5 events. Adapting real-world examples in most cases, events have in common that they significantly change an indicator of the game mechanics. Only Some events are exaggerated compared to real-world examples or have only a notification as a result:

How are the probability values determined? -Real world data (empirical from scientific sources, trustworthy google search results, self-estimation (rule of thumb) 

From the UI point of view, the events are displayed as Pop-Up windows. They are not part of the prototype due to the limitation of the prototype's features. The event list can be further extended when more game features are developed. Some events are proposed as ideas as the features they are based on are not conceptualized yet.
