\chapter{From a small startup to a global enterprise}
\label{cha:intro}
\section{What to expect from Capitalism X (CapX)}
Nike\\
Business simulation games...Fancy introduction, Target audience\\
Goal of business simulation game\\
User skills? Thinking economic entrepreneurial spirit...\\

Did you ever tested out your economic skills and entrepreneurial spirit? Did you ever wish to take action and do things your way? Did you ever thought that with the steering wheel in your hand, you'd give a company a whole new direction and possibility to rise? \\
CapitalismX now gives you the possibility to become CEO! This business simulation game, which is equally fun and educative, gives you the chance to prove your successful way of managing a company through decades.\\

\emph{Very Important:} Besides being a game-play handbook, this document also addresses the game mechanisms working in the background
 
\section{Player's role}
Maike\\
The user assumes the role of CEO for either a start-up or a midsize company which is about to fail. During his career, the player encounters several obstacles and leads the business. So, the user slips into various roles, such as head of human resources, production or logistics, in order to take the necessary measures to run a successful business. Daily tasks include hiring, firing, motivating and training employees, innovating and manufacturing products, deciding on the product portfolio, dealing with government issues and taking financial figures into account.
In summary, the player decides on all the features provided in our game. These decisions are included in finance, human resources, procurement, production, warehouse, logistics and marketing and affect the performance of the company.

\section{Setting \& Story}
\label{SettingStory}
Livja and Philipp\\
Timeframe from 1990 to 2017 in the first phase, Progress\\
The setting of the game is a fictional map of a town/city.  The player has to choose where to set up his first shop, in a vacant distant area or downtown.\\
Functional\ Non-functional buildings\\
Functional buildings: bank, government building, consultant firm, harbor(import/export), marketing firm, competitors \\
Non-functional buildings: City centre, Parks(increase employee satisfaction), sea/ river, roads(transportation)\\
Own currency: capcoins cc (value comparable to US Dollars) \\
Democratic government \\
One day in the game is 3 seconds in real time\\
Total playtime: 15 hours.\\
Storyline:\\
Mid-size IT company\\
Start option 1: We buy a mid size IT company which is about to fail 
(bad management)\\
Start option 2: We found a new Start-Up, so we can choose our employees and products ourselves
Different starting capitals\\
Products: see Product Flow Charts\\
Trading components\\
Make or Buy decisions for some products, not components\\
Organize your entire company from the CEO's perspective (incl. HR, Finance, Manufacturing, ect.)\\
Customer simulation regarding services, support and products \\
External events:\\
Handle random events(e.g natural disasters) (defined in Problem-Influence-Matrix)\\
And handle events that will be triggered by game settings(fire-old machines, company shut down - low eco-index,etc... )\\
Integration of games within CapX, e.g. play a round of Tetris to clean up the mess  in your warehouse (put in Outlook?)\\

\subsection{Production}
Livja, (Nike for Pricing and Selling) \\
 production is composed of three main elements: procurement(harbour), manufacturing, logistics(relate to following paragraph)\\
explain each sub-unit of these elements and adapt explanation and functions to the mock-up
procurement of products - component, component level, units, price, supplier \\
manufacturing
\begin{itemize} 
\item production technology-explain range of measurement, graph, possibilities to purchase machinery
\item manage individual machines (maintain, upgrade, sell) how these actions affect budget and technology measures
\item overall status of the machinery in the plant
\item production performance(production technology+employee skills)graph, how much each of these factors affect the overall production performance
 \item possible investments- player can decide how to improve production performance based on these options, can also decide the amount of Cap-Coins(cc) to invest
 \begin{itemize} 
 \item R\&D
 \item System Security
 \item Automation
 \end{itemize}
 \item eco-index(explain range)- how eco-index deteriorates, improves, events that may be triggered that require government intervention
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Procurement}
Nike explains how to use the procurement part.

\subsection{Marketing}
Janine\\
manage internal communication, external communication and legal topics for your company 
\\
internal communication: 
\begin{itemize} 
\item offering online courses and see an overview of the courses offered the last two years. (go green, stress management, teamwork, diversity, ...) 
\item perform an employee survey to get information about the employee satisfaction overall and in the single departments
\item perform an employee survey to see in detail what needs to be improved to achieve a higher employee satisfaction. See statistics of the last three employee surveys. (more internal courses, higher boni, more flexible working times, better work conditions, more training, other factors that play a role in calculating the employee satisfaction)   
\end{itemize}
external communication: 
\begin{itemize} 
\item Mange campaigns and  have an overview of the campaigns performed during the past two years.
Green company, diversity, CSR, promoting company, refugee program, etc. 
\item make official statements for the company to mitigate negative impacts. (data privacy and security efforts, stable prices, safe delivery times, apologize for longer delivery times, ...) 
\item market research 
\begin{itemize} 
\item Conduct market research to get useful information about your products, prices and general market position.
You are able to do the market research by yourself (in house) or  hire a market research institution (external). The advantage of doing the research in-house is the lower price. For every internal research you can choose between a verbal, telephone, written or online survey. It is important to understand the pros and cons of each type. For example, an oral survey is more expensive than an online one, but yields immediate results. By contrast, an online survey takes longer, which can cause the data to be slightly out of date. 
A detailed list of the pros and cons can be found in the table below. (insert table -todo) 
\item See the results of your research performed during the last two years 
\begin{itemize} 
\item price sensitive research for a specific product
\begin{itemize} 
\item Provides a price sensitive analysis for a specific product
\item The study isolates the impact of the price on the market shares while holding all the other factors (quality, …) constant.
\item The research shows the results for 9 price levels around the reference price (input), the price levels are from -20\% to +20\% in 5\% steps 
\item add example report -todo
\end{itemize}
\item customer satisfaction (company at all, specific product / last year in quarters) 
\begin{itemize} 
\item provides customer satisfaction estimated for a specific product (input) or the company at all
\item shows the results for the last four quarters 
\item add example report -todo
\end{itemize}
\item market statistic (overall company, product level) 
\begin{itemize} 
\item provides a variety of market information 
\item add example report -todo
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
legal topics: 
\begin{itemize} 
\item Lobbying (lobbyists can be used to influence the government and thereby mitigate the impact of e.g. environmental regulations on the company)
\item hire management consultancy (can help you to make important decisions and uncover mistakes that happen in your company) 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Logistics}
Janine
\begin{itemize} 
\item products are sold directly out of the warehouse (all produced products go into the warehouse first) 
\item If the demand for products is higher than the inventory, all products are sold from the warehouse. That means the inventory represents the maximum sales quantity for a product
\item If the demand for a product is lower than the inventory, only the demanded quantity is sold and thus delivered. The remaining products stay in the warehouse and cause storage costs
\item The capacity of the logistics fleet is measured by the number of trucks. Each truck makes it possible to deliver 1000 packages per day.
\item Cost Trucks:
\begin{itemize}
\item cost per delivery of 1000 packages
\item Acquisition costs for the truck (one time)
\item Maintenance costs for the truck (yearly or monthly)
\item trucks can be sold if they are not needed anymore. They are linear depreciated over 9 Years  
\end{itemize}
\item Is the demand and also the inventory of the products higher than the deliver capacity of the trucks and the company has no external logistic partner, the company has to pay a fix deliver price for each package
\item External logistic partner:
\begin{itemize}
    \item can be hired in the job market
    \item have a quality, eco and reliability -index
    \item cost per delivery of one package
    \item contractually agreed fixed costs (yearly or monthly) 
    \item possible to fire the actual partner and hire a new one. Only one logistic partner at the same time possible 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Choose the portfolio}
Nike \\
Description of products \\
As mentioned above in chapter xxxx, the player may offer two different types of products. Those two different groups are first manufactured goods, and second, retail products that are simply bought as a whole and resold under the company brand \\

To start with the retail products, consisting of two different sub-groups of products: the mass storage devices and the movie playback devices. As the products evolve over the time frame of the game, the scope of the single product group also changes. \\
Mass storage devices will evolve, given a decent investment to innovate, from CD over DVD to BlueRay, from small SD cards to SD cards with very large memory, and from USB Sticks with small memory and in simple versions to evolved versions with large memory. FURTHER DESCRIPTION OF PRODUCTS NEEDED?!
Movie playback devices may evolve from simple video recorders for recording tapes to DVD and BlueRay player, that even can become smart. \\

The larger part of the product portfolio is displayed by the manufactured goods. To produce those, the player has to slip into the role of a strategic head of manufacturing and has to take care about the education and satisfaction of employees in order to provide a high manufacturing and therefore also high product quality; about the procurement of components and warehousing of products; and so on.
The manufactured goods are divided into four product sub-groups, which are notebooks, phones, gameboys, and televisions. \\
Contrary to retail products, the manufactured products consist of single components, that the player needs to buy at the procurement (???) harbour. Also, the player needs engineers in order to aggregate the components to products. As described in section XXXX, the education and skills of the engineers influence the quality of the product. Other than that, the product quality is also determined on the component's actuality. Another difference to the retail products is, that the manufactured product's evolution is depicted by different levels, meaning that a notebook always stays a notebook, but it surely evolves to a higher performing version. To put it into a nutshell, the player has to continuously innovate and invest in new components, skilled engineers, and procurement of components in order to achieve the best competitive products. \\

Apart from that, the player has the possibility to produce more than one product from a product sub-group, which offers various strategic advantages. For example, it is possible to produce two different phones at the same time, to test out different features and product strategies in the market. Phone A could be a very basic, simple phone, suitable for basic tasks like phone calls, messages, emails, surfing in the web. Obviously, Phone A would have a rather cheap price, but also the components do not need to be the latest state of the art tech. Phone B on the other side, could be a very advanced hence expensive phone, including a high resolution camera, high-speed internet connectivity and a fast CPU.\\

\subsection{Lead the right employees}
Janine
\begin{itemize}
    \item find the right mix of employees in the market 
    \item each possible employee has an education level (worker to expert), the initial skill level of the employee is based on the education level
    \item the salary for a employee is affected by there individual skill level.
    \item You can influence the skill level of your employees with trainings 
    \item the higher the skill levels of the employees in the single departments the better the employees are working (e.g. quality in production, support, ...) 
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Trainings are performed on employee level, you decide which employees should be trained 
    \item Costs of training are calculated based on the type of training and the number of employees who are trained
    \item not every training influences the skill level in the same way 
    \end{itemize}
    \item it is also important to build a good work environment for the employees. This can be done by e.g. boni, home office, ...
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Make your company grow}
\begin{itemize}
    \item what are important KPIs
    \item possible way to lead the company

Livja \\
 Production definition \\
Production process considering industry best practice \\
Measures for Production: which ones we aim to increase/ decrease \\
 Factors that affect product quality 
\begin{itemize}
\item production technology
\item employee skills
\item supplier index
\item logistics
\item warehousing (storage facilities)
\end{itemize}
Specify which factors were relevant to our simulation \\
Relate factor to the corresponding chapter, emphasize their correlation in increasing product quality, explain the 5 points Likert scale for each factor\\
Production Technology: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Deprecated                  Scale: 1
    \item Old                         Scale: 2
    \item Good conditions             Scale: 3
    \item Purchased more than 5 years ago Scale: 4
    \item Brand new                   Scale: 5

\end{itemize}
The technology used in production starts at 5 points when all machinery is new. It lowers (-1) point over a 5 years time-span. It lowers (-2), if there is a fire, flood, hurricane.\\
This measure can be improved by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Purchasing new machinery (level 5)
\item Maintaining \& repairing (+1)
\item Upgrading (+2)
\end{itemize}


Productivity: factors that influence it \\
Give functions, equations for measuring each of the factors that affect productivity \\

Overall Graph

\section{Example Flowboard}
A flowboard is the best way to document a game’s structure. The term is derived
from a flowchart and a storyboard. Storyboards are a linear series of pictures
used by filmmakers to plan a set of shots. Flowcharts are diagrams used
by programmers for documenting an algorithm. A flowboard combines these
two ideas. Each picture is a sketch or a mockup of the screen, in one specific
gameplay mode or menu. The pictures are connected via arrows that indicate
under what circumstances the transition takes place. (1, p. 57; 3.) The flowboard
does not necessarily need pictures in it to work. A simpler approach (Figure
2) might even be better in some cases.

\section{External events}
This section deals with the influence of events that happen during the course of the game. Companies have to deal with influencing factors which are neither planned nor foreseeable\cite{Campbell}. This section refers to 'external' events as they are out of the players explicit and obvious control. Actions taken may still have an influence on an event's probability to happen, but this is invisible for the player. From a location point of view events can take place inside the company, for example strikes, or outside like rising taxes. Punishment for mistakes is common, but the player may also be rewarded when outstanding performance is present.  
There are 19 distinct events divided into 5 categories and acting as counterparts to the game features. In addition, they reflect different areas of of the company's business: 

\begin{itemize}
\item Production and Market events map to the production and procurement simulation. 
\item Money and Taxes. intervene with content of the finance simulation.  
\item Employees covers one event (strikes) which deals with the HR simulation.
\item Natural Disasters have an internal source for gaming purposes, but come from outside of the company. 
\item Government and Politics are a mostly invisible force that acts in the game. They are not visible to the player, but the impact is significant. 
\end{itemize}

Events are usually cross-functional. This means that the trigger of an event in a specific category comes from another one. This is also the case for the outcome of events. The categorization itself orientates on the nature of the event.

Characteristics of the events
\begin{itemize}
\item Random vs. Conditional probability
\item Rising Probability vs. Certain occurrence
\item Threshold applicable: yes / no
\item Impact on an Game Mechanic: yes / no
\end{itemize}
The decision which event should get which characteristic was based on multiple aspects. In general, a business simulation intends to reflect the real-world which is also applicable for events. Their nature and likeliness to happen are to be transferred to the game environment. But there are aspects which are contradictory to this intend. Empirical evidence for the probability of events might be rare or the probability is so low that they would happen almost never throughout the game. Events having such an impact that they lead to a Game-Over must not happen in an early state and frustrate the player. In the end gaming should be fun too, not only replaying the real-world. Reflecting the latter is also limited as a simulation can never cover every 'live' aspect. As a result of these considerations, a probability can distort from its real-world example. If suitable, an event can even have a complete random occurrence providing a more challenging game experience to the player. This is the case for 5 events. 



Adapting real-world examples in most cases, all events have in common that they have a significant impact on an indicator of the game mechanics. Some events are exaggerated compared to real-world examples.
