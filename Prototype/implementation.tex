\section{Prototype Implementation}
Steffen\\\\
CapitalismX is a Node.js\footnote{https://nodejs.org/} app written in JavaScript and the stylesheet language SASS\footnote{https://sass-lang.com}. It makes use of the library React\footnote{https://reactjs.org/} and its XML-like JavaScript syntax extension JSX to define user interface components. Furthermore, Redux\footnote{https://redux.js.org/} is used to manage the state of components and their communication with each other. 3D graphics are realized using Three.js\footnote{https://threejs.org/}. NPM\footnote{https://www.npmjs.com/} helps to manage dependencies and deployment.
\\
Various smaller NPM packages are used for a number of tasks. A full list of dependencies can be found in the \texttt{package.json} file in the root directory of the prototype project folder.\\\\
It should be possible to run the app in any state-of-the-art browser, but at the moment it is only tested in Google Chrome\footnote{https://google.com/chrome/} (version 72.0.3626.109).
\\
This section doesn't cover the prototype implementation in its entirety, but will highlight some of the key implementation decisions, especially those concerned with the game mechanics.
