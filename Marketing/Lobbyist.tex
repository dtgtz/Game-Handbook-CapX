If the company is in contact with a lobbyist, he tries to mitigate negative government decisions on the company. For its services the lobbyist demands a monthly compensation \textit{price}. The effect of the lobbyist is reflected by the \textit{taxRate}. 

Only one lobbyist can be assigned at a time, if the player wishes to hire another lobbyist, he must first fire the current one. Each lobbyist has a \textit{type}, a \textit{price} and a \textit{taxRate}. The \textit{type} determines how influential the lobbyist is, more precisely how high the \textit{taxRate} is due to his influence. The player can choose between four different lobbyists: Mayor, Workerâ€™s Union Leader, Congressman and Senator. The Senator is the most influential but also the most expensive lobbyist. Table \ref{influence_lobbyist} shows the relationship between \textit{type}, \textit{taxRate} and \textit{price}. 

\begin{table}[ht]

\begin{tabular}{|l|r|r|}
\hline
\textbf{Type}  & \textbf{taxRate}   & \textbf{price in cc} \\ \hline
None                    & 20\%      & 0 \\
Mayor                   & 18\%      & 1000     \\
Worker's Union Leader   & 16\%      & 2000     \\
Congressman             & 13\%      & 5000     \\
Senator                 & 10\%      & 10000     \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

In order to find out which lobbyist is the most rewarding one for the company, the player must calculate the amount of the tax reduction and compare it with the \textit{price} incurred by the lobbyist.
