\subsection{Company Image} \label{company_image}
%Philipp and Janine

The company image is a very important KPI to measure the company reputation. The company image is the sum of many small activities which leaves a footprint that can be recognized with the company. Single activities can improve or destroy the \textit{companyImage} (\gls{cI}) from the point of view of individuals. The goal of a high valued company image is of course monetary benefit. Therefore, activities which tend to increase the \textit{companyImage} are not for free and it is always a difficult assessment whether to invest in a certain activity or not. In the game we concentrated on factors which can be realistically and interestingly be influenced by the player.

\label{calculation_CI}
\end{table}

The total sum of the above possible choices is the total \textit{companyImage}. The score can reach values from 0 to 28 as it is the case for the \textit{employeeSatisfaction}. In order to build also here a more realistic representation we figured out that the marginal benefit of an increase of the \textit{companyImage} increases with the collected amount of points. Therefore, we manipulated also this formula and came up with the function that can be seen in figure \ref{fig:scaling}.

%is now on a single page, how can we solve this? but only by surrounding it with figure it is possible to give it a caption. 
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[
        axis lines = left,
        xlabel = Original Scale (\gls{oS}),
        ylabel = Company Image  (cIS),
        grid style = dashed,
        legend pos=north west
    ]
    \addplot [
        domain=0:28, 
        samples=28, 
        color=red,
    ]
    {x^2/7.84};
    \addlegendentry{$cIS=\frac{oS^2}{7.84}$}
    \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Scaling function companyImage}
    \label{fig:scaling}
\end{figure}

The original scale of 0 to 28 is squared and divided by the factor of 7.84 in order to map the original scale on a scale of 0 to 100. In this case the rational behind the mapping is the fact that little activities do not have such  a big influence on the overall \textit{companyImage}. When a company starts to combine all its activities it can generate huge impact and publicity which leads to a strong increase of the \textit{companyImage}.
